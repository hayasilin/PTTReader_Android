# PTT Reader Android

This is my demo project of making a Android app.

I would like to demonstrate:
- Android app with HTTP request
- Android unit testing
- Android UI testing (with [Espresso idling resources](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso/idling-resource))

## Code coverage

Make code coverage up to **96%**

**Generate code coverage report by running command line:**
```
./gradlew clean createDebugCoverageReport
```
